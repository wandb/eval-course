    "Intuitive Machines lands on the moon in historic first for a U.S. company Intuitive Machines Nova-C cargo lander, named Odysseus after the mythological Greek hero, is the first U.S. spacecraft to soft land on the lunar surface since 1972. Intuitive Machines is the first company to pull off a moon landing — government agencies have carried out all previously successful missions. The company's stock surged in extended trading Thursday, after falling 11 percent in regular trading.",
    "Lunar landing photos: Intuitive Machines Odysseus sends back first images from the moon Intuitive Machines cargo moon lander Odysseus returned its first images from the surface. Company executives believe the lander caught its landing gear sideways on the surface of the moon while touching down and tipped over. Despite resting on its side, the company's historic IM-1 mission is still operating on the moon.",
