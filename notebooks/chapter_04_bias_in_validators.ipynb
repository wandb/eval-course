        "LLM evaluators are incredibly effective tools for automating evaluation tasks, but they are not without their limitations. Like all LLM-based applications, they are susceptible to biases—both subtle and explicit. These biases don’t stem inherently from the concept of LLM evaluators themselves, but rather reflect the underlying patterns in the data and training processes that power modern LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding and addressing these biases is crucial because they can distort evaluation outcomes, undermine fairness, or misalign with human judgment. While these issues are artifacts of today’s LLM systems—products of imperfect datasets, model training dynamics, and real-world complexities—they represent challenges we must navigate thoughtfully. Importantly, ongoing advancements in model development and data curation could significantly reduce or eliminate these biases in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we’ll unpack common types of biases in LLM evaluators, demonstrate their real-world impact, and explore best practices to mitigate these biases, ensuring that evaluations remain reliable and aligned with desired objectives.\n"
